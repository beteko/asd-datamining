Data Analysis  performed on  Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on the Kaggle data set.

## Overview 
  Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. 
  People with ASD have difficulty with social communication and interaction, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors.
  Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is said to be a “developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life [5]. It is Known as also "spectrum" disorder because there is a wide variety and intensity of the symptoms that can be observed in a subject. The causes of that disorder are still unclear despite several researches and hypotesis made over the year. Some research suggests that genes can act together with influences from the environment to affect development in ways that lead to ASD. Other studys claim that  newborns who have Jaundice are more likely to be diagnosed with Autism.[6]

In view of the rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide, it is crucial to investigate on the possible factors and cause of this disorder. Our study will therefore  focus on  exploring and mining available records collected from various subjects evaluated at an early stage in order to come up a pattern or association rules that might provide insight on the possible factors that leads to ASD as well as proposing a model that predicts the risks of a toddler deveoloping the disoder based on certain criteria. The study will seek to answer the below questions : 
  - Is there any proof from the collected dataset that ASD  is linked to genes or/and Jaundice 
  - Can we exploit  any significant pattern between the symptoms and the gender/sex , origin/ethnicity , family history and Jaundice status  of the subjects 
  - Can we predict the risk level of a child/toddler developing  ASD based of his on  his sex/gender, origin/ethnicity and family history?
